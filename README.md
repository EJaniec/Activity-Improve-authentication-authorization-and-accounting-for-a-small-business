<h1>Activity-Improve-authentication-authorization-and-accounting-for-a-small-business</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
In this activity, I learned the importance of assessing access controls within a business. I discovered that access controls play a crucial role in managing access, authorization, and accountability of information. Authentication controls verify the identity of individuals, while authorization controls grant permissions and set limits on their actions. I now understand that well-implemented access controls are essential for reducing the likelihood of security risks. This knowledge has equipped me to analyze current processes, identify issues, and make recommendations to enhance security practices. I recognize the significance of completing this activity as it serves as a practical application of the concepts learned. I look forward to comparing my work with the exemplar provided in the next course item to further refine my understanding.
