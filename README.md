<h2>Overview</h2>
In this activity, I learned the importance of assessing access controls within a business. I discovered that access controls play a crucial role in managing access, authorization, and accountability of information. Authentication controls verify the identity of individuals, while authorization controls grant permissions and set limits on their actions. I now understand that well-implemented access controls are essential for reducing the likelihood of security risks. This knowledge has equipped me to analyze current processes, identify issues, and make recommendations to enhance security practices. I understand that completing this activity is important because it serves as a practical application of the concepts learned.
